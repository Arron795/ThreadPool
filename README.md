A ThreadPool based on Linux pthread library

Based on the pthread library under Linux, use C/C++to implement a thread pool that includes task queues, worker threads, and manager threads, involving mutexes and conditional variable/semaphore blocking.

基于 Linux 下的 pthread库，使用C/C++实现一个包含任务队列、工作线程、管理者线程的线程池，涉及互斥锁和条件变量/信号量阻塞。
